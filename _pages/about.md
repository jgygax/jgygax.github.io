I am a PhD student in the lab of [Friedemann Zenke](https://zenkelab.org) at the [Friedrich Miescher Institute](https://fmi.ch), where I work in computational neuroscience and focus on understanding spiking neural networks.

I completed my master's degree in biomedical engineering at [ETH Zürich](https://ee.ethz.ch/de/). During my master's I worked on a biologically plausible implementation of an autoencoder in spiking neural networks in Giacomo Indiveri's lab at [INI](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en.html) and I wrote my master's thesis in Benjamin Grewe's lab on minimum norm optimization.

Before that, I received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and information technology from [ETH Zürich](https://ee.ethz.ch/de/). During my final year, I was a member of the [Cardex](https://cardex.ethz.ch/) focus project team. We developed a transcatheter mitral valve repair simulator as a novel training technology for cardiovascular interventions.
