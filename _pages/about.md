I am a PhD student in the lab of [Friedemann Zenke](https://zenkelab.org) at the [Friedrich Miescher Institute](https://fmi.ch), where I work in computational neuroscience and focus on understanding spiking neural networks.  

Before that, I received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and information technology from [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ee.ethz.ch/de/), the swiss federal institute of technology. During my final year, I was a member of the [Cardex](https://cardex.ethz.ch/) focus project team. We developed a transcatheter mitral valve repair simulator as a novel training technology for cardiovascular interventions.

Subsequently, I completed a master's degree in biomedical engineering at [ETH Zurich](https://ee.ethz.ch/de/). I focused more on computational neuroscience and wrote my master's thesis in Benjamin Grewe's lab.
